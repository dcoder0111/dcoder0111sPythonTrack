# freezingMonkeysPythonTrack
Hi! My name is Dakota and here are some notes for the basic implementation of python in data science and machine learning. I will be updating these notes as I learn and teach others. :) Feel free to contact me to suggest edits!

Here is the order in which you should study this learners track:

1. Copy_of_colab_tutorial.ipynb (covers basic concepts such as data types, containers, functions, classes, numpy, and some matplotlib)
2. matplotlib_basics.ipynb (a more in depth look into matplotlib)
3. Pandas.ipynb (covers basics for pandas in webscraping and other circumstances)
4. web_scraping_basics.ipynb (covers web scraping with BeautifulSoup and XML)
5. Nike_HTML_webscraping_example.ipynb (covers HTML webscraping)
6. NikeShoes_homework.ipynb (extension of the above activity)

Have fun coding!
